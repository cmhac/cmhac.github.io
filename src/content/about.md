---

I'm an investigative data journalist and software engineer specializing in uncovering stories through data analysis and custom software development. With a unique blend of journalistic instinct and technical expertise, I build tools that help reveal hidden patterns and untold stories in complex datasets.

My work focuses on developing innovative solutions for investigative reporting challenges. Whether it's creating data pipelines to process large datasets, building web scrapers to gather public information, or developing interactive visualizations to communicate findings, I combine technical skill with journalistic rigor to produce impactful stories.

I'm particularly interested in projects that leverage technology to enhance transparency and accountability in public institutions. My experience includes working with public records, analyzing government databases, and developing tools to make complex information more accessible to the public.

When I'm not coding or investigating, I'm often exploring new technologies, contributing to open-source journalism tools, or collaborating with other journalists to enhance their technical capabilities. I believe in the power of technology to amplify investigative journalism's impact on society.
