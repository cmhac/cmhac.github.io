I'm an investigative data journalist and software engineer specializing in uncovering stories through data analysis and custom software development. With a unique blend of journalistic experience and technical expertise, I build tools that help reveal hidden patterns and untold stories.

I'm particularly interested in projects that leverage technology to enhance transparency and accountability in public institutions. My experience includes working with public records, creating data pipelines to process large datasets, building web scrapers to gather public information, and developing tools to make complex information more accessible to my newsroom and our audience.

When I'm not coding or investigating, I'm often exploring new technologies, contributing to open-source tools, or collaborating with other reporters to learn more about the intersection of technology and journalism.
