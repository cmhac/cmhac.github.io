Partnering with CBS News Texas for this story, I merged TEA staffing files with student-enrollment counts, calculated the psychologist-to-pupil ratio for all 1,200+ Texas school districts, and overlaid a fresh scrape of the state’s TCHATT telehealth roster to map where kids can — or can’t — see a mental-health professional at school.

The numbers were stark: 593 districts have no psychologist at all, only 39 meet the 1:700 best-practice ratio, and more than 800 aren’t even plugged into the state’s tele-therapy safety net.
