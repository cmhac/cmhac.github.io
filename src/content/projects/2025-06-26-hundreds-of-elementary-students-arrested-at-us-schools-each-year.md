Drawing on the U.S. Department of Education’s 2017-18 Civil Rights Data Collection, I isolated every elementary school that reported at least one “school-related arrest,” then spent weeks confirming each figure with districts and state education officials, pruning out erroneous, records.

With a cleaned, open-sourced dataset and reproducible code on GitHub, I calculated arrest totals and rates, broke them down by race and disability status, and mapped where the youngest children were most likely to be handcuffed.

The analysis revealed more than 700 arrests of kids as young as five in a single year and showed that Black students and children with disabilities bore a sharply disproportionate share — findings that sparked calls for discipline reform and gave parents, educators, and lawmakers actionable, district-level evidence of the problem.
